# HW3: Custom KNN Implementation

This project involves implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier.

## Project Overview
**KNN Implementation**

In this homework, I implemented three custom **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifiers designed to handle different types of data without standard preprocessing:
- **Numeric Features**
- **Categorical Features**
- **Mixed Features**

The implementation uses separate distance metrics for each feature type and combines them in a weighted fashion to accurately classify new instances.
