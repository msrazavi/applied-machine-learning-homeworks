# HW1: Student Grade Management System

This project is part of the "Python Quick Review" module. The goal is to build a console-based application to demonstrate a grasp of core Python principles.

## Project Overview
**Being Familiar with Python**

In this assignment, I built a Student Grade Management System using procedural programming. This console-based app handles:
- Student records management.
- Course details tracking.
- Grade computations.

*Note: The project may also incorporate classes and is developed within a Python virtual environment to ensure dependency isolation.*
