# HW2: University Course Data Analysis

This project focuses on data manipulation and visualization using Python's core data science libraries.

## 📖 Project Overview
**Being Familiar with Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib**

I created a data analysis application that simulates analyzing university course performance data. The workflow includes:
1. **Data Generation:** Generating synthetic data to simulate student performance.
2. **Processing:** Cleaning and processing data using **Pandas**.
3. **Calculation:** Performing numerical calculations with **NumPy**.
4. **Visualization:** Creating various visualizations (charts/graphs) using **Matplotlib** to interpret the data.
